Seasoned Software Engineer with extensive experience at SoundHound as a Senior Software Engineer. Pioneered as the company's first non-English language model developer, spearheading comprehensive code development for multilingual language model projects. Notably, I built from scratch the pre-processing for Japanese language model training data, contributing significantly to the release of commercial-grade language models. In addition to creating a plethora of ancillary tools, such as language model inspection utilities, I developed backend systems with RESTful APIs and corresponding front-end applications to ensure cross-team usability. Instrumental in architecting language model build pipelines and crafting dashboards for enhanced data management and visibility.
